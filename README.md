Creating a dynamic chart that displays real-time data updates using Chart.js and Anime.js can be a great way to visualize changing data. Below, I'll provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this. Please note that I won't be able to provide a direct link to a readme file, but I'll guide you through the process.

## Prerequisites:
 ### Make sure you have Chart.js and Anime.js installed. You can include them in your HTML like this:

### html
Copy code
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animejs/3.2.1/anime.min.js">
Create an HTML element for your chart:

#### html
Copy code
<canvas id="real-time-chart" width="400" height="200"></canvas>

In the example above, we initialize a line chart using Chart.js and Anime.js for animations. The updateChartData function adds a new data point to the chart and updates it, and the setInterval function simulates real-time updates by adding random data every second. You can replace the random data with actual data from your source.
